# Malaria-in-Africa
I explored the Malaria in Africa dashboard as my first project in udacity's business analysis Nanodegree program.
The dashboard showed how countries in africa were affected by malaria from 2000 to 2014.
The dashbord contained two visuals; a Map showing the different Countries in Africa which includes Senegal, Eygpt, Niger, benin republic, Nigeria e.t.c and a Column Chart showing the number of deaths due to malaria over time for each Country.
In this analysis, I would be showing the two most affected Countries and the least affected country according to the dashboard.
